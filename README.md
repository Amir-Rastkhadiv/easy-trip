## INTRODUCTION 

With Easy Trip, travellers can plan their trips with ease. Users can find the best holiday destination for their needs. The website allows visitors to explore cities worldwide. Travellers will be able to access information about local attractions and accommodations and search for hotels and weather forecasts. 

The application is highly user-friendly, enabling users to access data, maps, and travel packages by selecting /searching from the site or its sponsors, meeting their desired goals for holidaymakers while ensuring they receive the best possible experience.


APIs suit visitor needs and allows users to search for their next holiday destination. Users can find accommodation, and they can also find places to eat and top attractions nearby.As travel is such a big industry, I undertook this project to connect with external websites like restaurant hotels and travel agencies, knowing that there would be many websites. It provides holidayers with the best possible experience across the globe, based on their preference.

Last but not least, the developer/owner of this website has incorporated design and technology to produce an excellent website using User Experience Design (UXD). The development of a captivating website follows the principles, standards, and professional advice provided by South Devon University Centre College and the Code Institute.

We offer [ Easy Trip](https://amir-rastkhadiv.github.io/easy-trip/)planning for your holiday.

## INTERLUDE

- ### TOOLKITS:

-  ### WEB DEVELOPMENT OF THE MODERN ERA:

-  ### A WEBPAGE? WHAT IS A WEBSITE? HOW ABOUT A GOOD ONE? 

-  ### TERMINOLOGY:

-  #### UXD
   User experience refers to how something affects a person.
This discipline ensures that a product works is simple, intuitive, and enjoyable to use.
Embedding user experience strategies at the beginning of the development process is essential. UX is all about ensuring "yes" at all times.

   -  #### UCD
   By using user-centered design, we can achieve a positive user experience. In fact, user-centered design ensures that your product will be loved by users over and over again.

   -  #### UID
   In human-computer interaction (HCI), a user interface is the interface between humans and machines. In this way, the machine is controlled and operated from the human end, while simultaneously providing information to aid the operator's decision-making.

   - #### WHAT DOES SOFTWARE CRAFTMANSHIP ENTAIL?
   A software craftsman believes that software design is more than just hammering the keyboard until your program works as it should. A good approach is to consider the total cost of ownership of a product, e.g., the costs of developing the software and fixing all the defects and maintaining it for many years to come.

My work on the website has focused on generating positive user experiences by mapping, designing an incredible journey, and arranging details for creating the product, all while interacting with web applications.When you fully understand the framework's intricacies, it's enjoyable to write beautiful, well-factored code along with a deadline.

Love Journey? Thriled to code? What about coding an easy trip?

## USER EXPERIENCE (UX)

- ### GETTING STARTED

To begin, let's review the essential What, Who, Which, and Where questions. Visual learners tend to find these simple WH questions easy since you can use visual aids, like a picture or an object, as hints. Then, it is simple to move on to asking "When," "Why," and "How."

[Keep Things on Track by Asking the Right Questions](https://amir-rastkhadiv.github.io/fun-gym/)

- ### WHAT EXACTLY IS USER EXPERIENCE?

In a nutshell, a helpful, usable, and valuable product is user experience(UX). It identifies and describes a product's goals, user interface, and interaction with users to determine its success.

There are five phases in UX: strategy, scope, structure, skeleton, and surface. These include tasks, functionality, and information. Therefore, it would be better to prioritize a specific project goal while simultaneously dealing with data.


- ### WHAT IS THE UX SYSTEM IS USED FOR? 

Using the above design system helps you do two things well: Improve consistency and receive coded patterns that you can quickly implement for the following project.
A UX is composed of connected planes. Planes will exchange information, resulting in a complete product. In this process, flexibility is paramount.

-  ### SURFACE PLANE

The surface plane deals with visual languages like colours, fonts, orders, and sequences in contents. Mainly we are concerned about the readability and the site identity at this stage. You should make sure that your content is legible, that the font contrasts with the background, and that there are consistent patterns.

To design Easy Trip, the developer addressed the following questions: 

- Describe what the final result will appear? 
- Which colours, typography, and design elements will you use?
- How can users interact with the design?
- Which effects will you implement on the site?
- Where can users click?
- How will users navigate?
- Which version of the information will appear on the screen in the end?

- ####  COLOUR SCHEME

Colour improves the aesthetic appeal of a website in more than one way. Colour can also influence and evoke certain kinds of emotions in users. Colour psychology has served as a powerful tool for logo branding and marketing. 

This summary of colour studies shows how Easy Trip's developer used those benefits in the logo and on all of its pages:  

-  Colour Psychology :

   * Red

      - Excitement and energy 
      - Youththul
      - Bold 
      - Urgency

   *  White

      - Simplicity
      - Clarity 
      - Purity
      - Stability and peace

    *  Green (Website in construction - progress bar)

      - Growth and development
      - Ratio and balance 
      - Calmness, coolness and peace 

    * Black 

      - Classic
      - Elegance and stylish
      - Powerful 

    * Yellow

      - Feeling of happiness and joy  
      - Optimissm 
      - Powerful 

    * Blue 
    
      - Reliable 
      - Trust and Truth 
      - Dependeble 
      - Professional 
      - Wisdom 

-  Colour Pallete :

The colour palette in the digital world is a collection of colours that create a certain mood or feel. Models for the design include colour wheels, subtractive colour models, and additive colour models. The most significant difference is their primary, secondary, and tertiary colours. The method of the Easy Trip website design includes model C. Indeed, The primary colours in an additive colour model are red, green, and blue (RGB). Also, the designer applied Hex triplets to represent RGB colours in the CSS style sheet.  

![Figure 11: Colour models](./)

<p align="center">Figure</p>

Following our colour psychology section discussed earlier, warm colours like red and yellow create passionate feelings; cool colours like blue and green create reliable and calming moods; neutral colours soften or enhance sophisticated consistencies. In general, primary colours exert powerful visual and psychological effects. 

Using warm and cool colours will not result in an aesthetically pleasing design. The solution is to use neutral colours. Colours in this category typically include black, white, grey, and various shades of brown.

These colour schemes are purposely selected. My mind raced when I was deciding what sort of message I wanted Easy Trip to convey.The main colours used throughout the website are displayed in the follwing pallete. Contrast is achieved throughout the application by using white fonts.

- ####  TYPOGRAPHY



- ####  IMAGERY

There is an old saying that a picture is worth a thousand words. As a result, the human brain processes visuals 60,000 times faster than text, and people retain 80% of what they see but only 20% of what they do.

There are the following main categories for the project images:
1) [](/assets/img/)
2) [The README document Figures](#TABLE-OF-FIGURES)
3) [Layouts(Wireframes/Sketches](#LAYOUTS)
4) [Photos of tests' outcomes](#TESTING)

PNG (Portable Network Graphics) is the most commonly used image format in the Easy Trip project. Images in PNG can have 16 million colours. However, other forms, such as JPG or JPEG (JPG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group), icons with appropriate animations, and PDF files, have been utilized. 
 
To create each of those in the Easy Trip project, the designer applied different tools and resources. For further information, please have a look at the links below:

## TESTING

The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.

-   [W3C Markup Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input)

-   [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input)
